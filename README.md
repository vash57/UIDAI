📁 Analysis Notebooks Overview
1️⃣ Enrolment Data Cleaning & Analysis

Notebook: enrolment_cleaning.ipynb

This notebook focuses on cleaning and preprocessing Aadhaar enrolment datasets. It includes:

Merging multiple CSV files into a unified dataset

Standardizing state and region names

Removing duplicates and inconsistencies

Preparing age-group and time-series data for analysis

📌 Purpose: To accurately identify enrolment patterns and peak load periods across states.

2️⃣ Demographic Update Analysis

Notebook: demographic_analysis.ipynb

This notebook analyzes demographic update requests such as name, address, date of birth, and mobile number changes. Key highlights include:

Identifying high-frequency update types

Understanding adult-dominated update behavior

Linking update patterns to repeated centre visits

📌 Purpose: To justify online self-service filtering and awareness-based solutions.

3️⃣ Biometric Update & Failure Analysis

Notebook: biometric_analysis.ipynb

This notebook examines biometric update trends and failure-prone user groups. It covers:

Age-wise biometric update distribution

High failure rates among manual laborers and senior citizens

Correlation analysis between biometric updates and total enrolments

📌 Purpose: To support iris-based authentication prioritization and doorstep service recommendations.

4️⃣ Final Insights & Policy Recommendations

Notebook: final_insights.ipynb

This notebook consolidates findings from all analyses and connects data insights to real-world service challenges. It highlights:

State-wise service pressure zones

Root causes of overcrowding

Data-backed justification for proposed solutions

📌 Purpose: To bridge the gap between raw data analysis and actionable governance insights.

🔍 Why This Matters

By providing direct access to our analytical notebooks, this project ensures:

Transparency: All findings are backed by visible data processing steps

Reproducibility: Insights can be independently verified

Scalability: The same approach can be reused for future UIDAI datasets
